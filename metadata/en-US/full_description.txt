OpenPaperview's purpose is to browse, search in, download and display or send OpenPaper.work documents.
A static HTTPS server is required but the application is designed to be useable offline
with configurable pre-download and local full-text search.
See <a href="https://github.com/bwt/OpenPaperView?tab=readme-ov-file#openpaperview">full setup instructions</a>.
